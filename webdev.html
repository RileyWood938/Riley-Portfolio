				<h5>My Web Development Experience</h5>
				<br>
				<p>In the fall 2021 semester, I took an introduction to web development class at New College of Florida. As a component of that course, I created this website, along with several others which you can veiw below. In this course I learned how to create HTML documents, how to apply stylesheets, and how to integrate Javascript and JQuery scripts into my websites.</p>
				<br>
				<h5>Take a look at some of my projects:</h5>
				<dl><!--add list of projects worked on-->
					<dt><a href="http://samicemek.com/MetzRebuild_Programming/">Metz Rebuild</a></dt>
						<dd>This assignment asked students to reimagine the food service's website for New college of florida. I woked with 1 teammate to create this website and we uised a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</dd>
					<dt><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19E2huDGXOXWZ8aYT8dMKhta7CBK2RUFa/view?usp=sharing">Mezt Redesign</a></dt>
						<dd>This project also asked students to redesign the School food services website, this time using Adobe XD rather than creating an actual website. Again I worked with 1 teammate on this, and our Metz Rebuild project was largely based off of this design.</dd>
					<dt><a href="https://rileywood938.github.io/BandWebsite/">Ficticious Band Website</a></dt>
						<dd>This was my first solo project, Creating a website for a band that included embedded video, images, and forms. Looking back at this project I would change a lot, but it was an important learning experience.</dd>
					<dt><a href="" onclick="alert('Coming Soon!');">Cookie Sale Website</a></dt> <!--I added this alert becasue I find my cookie website unacceptable when compared to my current work. I don't want it associated with my proffesional identity outside of as a learning experience, however the assignment requires all projects to be listed-->
						<dd>This was my first ever website, made to sell cookies from a fake bakery.</dd>
